# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
  Hang In There is a dynamic web application that displays customizable inspirational posters on the web page. It offers features that allow the user to generate random poster images, titles and quotes from a catalog of existing examples as well as allowing the user to create their own poster from scratch. Additionally, the user can save created posters to a saved gallery.
